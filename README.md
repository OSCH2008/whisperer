Data sender to send data between computers on your local network

#### This is currently unfinished, here is a list of what I have left to do:
- Save chat history and private keys to a file after the below changes are fixed
- Fix message history not showing up when someone adds you, and you messaging them first .. fixed?
- Fix messages sending nowhere when the other end deletes you, and sending wrong emssages when that user re-adds you .. fixed?
- Use cfg attributes to change Nix to Linux
- Initialize chat history on receiving end
- Press ENTER to send
