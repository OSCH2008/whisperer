Data sender to send data between computers on your local network

#### This is currently unfinished, here is a list of what I have left to do:
- Use cfg attributes to change Nix to Linux
- Press ENTER to send
- Clear IP entry field on focus
- Save chat history and private keys to a file

It is in a usable state now that all major bugs are fixed!!!!
