Data sender to send data between computers on your local network

#### This is currently unfinished, here is a list of what I have left to do:
- Save chat history and private keys to a file
- Fix message history not showing up when someone adds you, and you messaging them first
- Fix messages sending nowhere when the other end deletes you, and sending wrong emssages when that user re-adds you
- Use cfg attributes to change Nix to Linux
